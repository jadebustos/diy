There are a couple of them in [Thingverse](https://www.thingverse.com):

You will have to buy a couple of bearings. See each of the above to get the size of bearings.

I bought [these bearings](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B01N6BFM6Y/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which fit with [Anti_Z-Wobble_Left](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2436455/).

> **Note**: I had to use a Dremel machine and sandpaper to sand the pieces for the bearings and metal stick fit.

You will need to print two pieces Print to reduce z-wobble (improves stability and reduce vibrations). Printed with infill equal to 100 %.
