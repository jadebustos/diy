## Changing the extruder main board connector

When choosing the extruder verify if the connector is a three-pin connector or a two-pin connector. Anet A8 uses the three-pin connector:

If your extruder has a 2-pin connector:

You will need to remove the 2-pin connector:

You can use a female-to-male ends connector wire cable to connect it to the mainboard:

> May you have to sand the extruder feed to be certain than it tightens wel with the metal piece.

Here you will have to adjust this screw to be able to push the extruder feeder down to introduce PLA/ABS filament:

> If this is not properly aligned the printing will be irregular showing "empty spaces".

Mount the extruder and be certain that extruder is properly aligned with the filament hole. You can use a 1,5 allen key:
