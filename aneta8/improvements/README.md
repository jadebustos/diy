# Anet A8 improvements

These are the improvements I have made to the ANET A8.

## Ease printing

+ Use a crystal as a bed surface instead of painter's tape. Use a crystal together with hairspray.
+ [Extruder feeder upgrade](extruder.md), eases filament removal avoiding filament getting stuck.

## Stability (reduce vibrations)

+ [T-corner](t-corner.md) to reduce z-wobble.
+ [Anti Z wobble v3](anti-z-wobble.md) to reduce z-wobble.
