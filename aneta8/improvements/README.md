# Anet A8 improvements

These are the improvements I have made to the ANET A8 in chronological order:

+ Use a crystal as a bed surface instead of painter's tape. Use a crystal together with hairspray.
+ [Extruder feeder upgrade](extruder.md), eases filament removal avoiding filament getting stuck.
+ [T-corner](t-corner.md) to reduce z-wobble.

The pending ones:

* [MOSFET for hotbed](mosfet-hotbed.md)
* [Power switch](power-switch.md)
* [Wheel bearing](wheel-bearing.md)
* [Spool holder redux](spool-holder-redux.md)
